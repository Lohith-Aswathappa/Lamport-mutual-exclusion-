CS/CE/TE 6378: Project I

In this project, you are expected to implement Lamportâ€™s Mutual Exclusion Algorithm. Knowledge of threads
and socket programming and its APIs in the language you choose is expected. Each process (server/client)
must execute on a separate machine (dcxx).

1. Extract the file in any folder.
2. connect to the DCXX machine.
3. open duplicate terminals on the DCXX machine
4. run the server file from the src directory in the extracted folder 
	Syntax - java Server (server Number) (path to server.txt) // if server.txt is in the same folder as that of server class file, no need to mention path to it
5. run the client file from the src directory in the extracted folder 
	Syntax - java Server (server Number) (path to client.txt)(path to server.txt) // if client.txt  & server.txt is in the same folder as that of server class file, no need to mention path to it
6. all the files that are written are in the files folder and need to modified in the server.txt/client.txt file according to the path where the file is extracted.
